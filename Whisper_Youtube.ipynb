            "[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840]  And what that means is\n",
            "[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.320]  If you think about it\n",
            "[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.320]  Breakouts happen on almost every bar. In other words a stop entry is a breakout\n",

            "[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.320]  The context is changing even more traders are selling\n",
            "[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.520]  And because of that you have a breakout from this this high all the way down here\n",
            "[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.520]  Which means any pullback is probably going to be minor and lead to sideways to down trading\n",
            "[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.080]  Therefore as far as limit order goes, it's better to be selling and scaling in higher\n",
            "[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.720]  Than buying and scaling in lower. So there's a there's a directional bias to the trade\n",

            "[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.560]  You know, it's kind of like if you're buying\n",
            "[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.240]  During this bear bar, that's a pretty difficult trade\n",
            "[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.680]  So the first thing i'm doing is i'm always asking myself. What is the always in direction?\n",

            "[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.080]  Remember\n",
            "[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:32.640]  A strong a weak stop entry trade is a great limit order trade\n",
            "[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:40.480]  So what does that mean? Well, let's take a look right here. This doji right here. That's a weak stop entry short\n",
            "[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.360]  That's a bad stop entry sell. It's a low one short\n",
            "[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:52.400]  Big tail a lot of overlap following a bull bar right here. That's a low one sell and there's probably buyers below the bar\n",
            "[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.320]  And because of that since it's a bad stop entry short, it's a decent limit order buy\n",

            "[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:08.400]  That's a terrible limit order buy because it's a reasonable stop entry short. It's a second entry sell\n",
